# Crypto Profit Tracker

Wrote this project because can't find a way to keep tracks of CryptoCoins that I bought at certain trade price in relative to either BTC / USD then keep tracks of my gains comparing to the current trade price. API is expected to be taken from [coincap.io](http://coincap.io/).

## Features Development
[ ] Input a Buy / Sell Transactions: Date, Value & From Currency, Value & To Currency, RateValue & Conversion (e.g.: ETH / BTC, ETH to BTC).
